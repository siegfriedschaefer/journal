# journal

This is the first application build for the mypai community.
It will be build by the help of Claude Sonnet (for proove of accomplish).

This app is build with vite.

It is a PWA with Wallet support.

All journal entries are signed, encrypted and stored on a decentral storage (IPFS, Filecoin or AR, to be defined).

Journal will have AI support for help analysing mood flows and some other, higher sophisticated ideas :-)
